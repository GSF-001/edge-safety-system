# System Overview

This document describes a personal-scale safety and incident response architecture.

The system is designed to:
- detect safety anomalies early
- prioritize user consent
- escalate incidents in controlled tiers
- preserve forensic integrity

The architecture is documentation-first and privacy-constrained by design.
