# Personal Safety Architecture

A lightweight, privacy-first system design for personal incident detection  
and controlled emergency escalation.

This repository documents the **core architecture**, **decision logic**,  
and **edge-to-backend coordination** for a non-intrusive safety system.

## Principles
- Edge-first detection
- Explicit consent gating
- Minimal data exposure
- Deterministic, explainable logic

## Repository Layout
- `docs/`        — System documentation & design rationale
- `algorithms/`  — Core detection & escalation logic
- `pseudocode/`  — Readable reference implementations
- `diagrams/`    — Sequence & flow visualizations

## Scope
This is **not a production system**.  
It is a **design reference** for architecture, logic flow, and decision models.

## Status
Conceptual / Architectural reference.
